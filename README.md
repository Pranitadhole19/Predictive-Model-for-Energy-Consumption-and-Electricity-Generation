## Project1 : Energy-Consumption-and-Electricity-Generation-Analysis

**Abstract:**
This code analyzes a dataset on world energy consumption and electricity generation trends. It explores various aspects such as energy sources, greenhouse gas emissions, 
and energy self-sufficiency across countries. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and classification models to predict a country's energy self-sufficiency level.

**Problem Statement:**
The primary goal is to gain insights into global energy consumption patterns, identify trends in renewable and non-renewable energy sources, and classify countries based on their energy self-sufficiency levels. This analysis aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the energy sector and its impact on greenhouse gas emissions, as well as identify countries that are heavily reliant on energy imports and potential areas for increasing domestic energy production or diversification.

**Scope:**
The code covers the following tasks:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations
3. Analyzing trends in energy sources, electricity generation, and greenhouse gas emissions
4. Classifying countries into different levels of energy self-sufficiency (e.g., high, moderate, low)
5. Evaluating and comparing the performance of machine learning models for the classification task

**Learning Outcome:**
By working through this code, one can learn:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques, including handling missing values and feature engineering
2. Exploratory data analysis and data visualization using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly
3. Understanding and interpreting energy consumption and electricity generation trends
4. Applying machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees) for classification tasks
5. Evaluating model performance using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
6. Techniques for hyperparameter tuning and feature selection to improve model performance

This analysis provides valuable insights into the global energy landscape, highlighting the importance of renewable energy sources and energy self-sufficiency. It also demonstrates the application of data analysis and machine learning techniques to real-world problems in the energy sector.
